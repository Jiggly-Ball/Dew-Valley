# Dew-Valley

A stardew-valley inspired game made by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c)

This repo has all the features as the tutorial shows but along with that I have added some more stuff like-
- Screen manager
- Animation class.
- Code organization.
- Type hinting.
- Code optimization.
- Some more assets & graphical features.
- And many other code-related features allowing more reusable code in other projects

## Demo video-

(Don't mind the very bad audio & video quality since it's highly compressed)

## Downloading-
If you want to play the game yourself you can download the executable from [here](https://github.com/Jiggly-Balls/Dew-Valley/releases/tag/v1.0).
Note that the executable may be laggy or even be flagged as a virus by your antivirus, hence it's recommended to `git clone` this project and run it 
through your installed python version manually.
